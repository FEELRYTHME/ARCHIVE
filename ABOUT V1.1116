ABOUT V1.1116

Looks like i just skipped that one because the update come so fast in that time.
I can't downgrade the games, guys. i don't have versions v1.1116 too, Hope you understand. 
I Just only create it with the game version i have (The Latest will be priority for me).

I check old archive and everything i have, some line coloms and everything could be a different for every single version, in this case i cant' make it for versions v1.1116 
that's why you can't use the different type of versions (Will Be Stuck, Black Screen issue, Crashing game etc).

For late notice, 
the last files i created really better than the oldest.
As you know I recommended to you all for updating game versions to the latest (Update For V1.1209.0.0)

Really sorry, it will get me tired if i take care of this too much. 

Just Listen To Me
The best way you got is. 
"Just Update it to the latest versions (Update For V1.1209.0.0)". 

Thats more better for you all, Best You Had.

Thats it, Thank for read this.
Thank for everything, Forgive me.

H4ZE.
